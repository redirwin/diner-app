# Diner Ordering and Payment System

I developed this app from scratch with plain JavaScript from a Figma design and instructor requirements. It is not intended to be a full-fledged production project, but demonstrates a small subset of my abilities as a developer. 

The live hosted site can be [found here](https://daves-diner.netlify.app/). 

**Requirements were:**
* Follow the [design spec](https://www.figma.com/file/iFFwsp3hRgXPTuorN8ZrzT/Mobile-Restaurant-Menu?node-id=0%3A1&t=RsJMe93UGVGuMfCZ-1)
* Render three menu options using JavaScript
* Be able to add/remove items
* Have a payment modal with compulsory form inputs

**Major aspects of the app were:**
* Render a menu of items provided in a data file
* All users to add and remove items from their order list and track the order total
* Render a modal with a form for submitting required order details
* Render a thank you page after the form has been submitted

**Additional functionality I added:**
* I added a secondary function to check validity of user submitted form data
* The modal resolves to a short submission SVG when the form is submitted

Per the design specs, the viewport was assumed to be 600px wide and the app has only limited responsiveness.
